TODO:
    test effect of scale
    validate norm error (expand his code and compare error values for
    individual entries - they will be different, how much?)
    run test code on test images
    create a classifier -> err rate max, rej rate max, custom
    ALL THE FUCKING COMMENTS

Profile:
    load time
    1err pass iterative, vec, drA, maybe cumsum
    adaboost algo
    test code (maybe implement cumsums) {1,20,50,100,200 feats} (may be an
    issue with our 'complete' feature set)
    feature creation

Analysis:
    (For our method and Dr A's method)
    4 classes of feature
    7k images for training
    24k for testing (mainly non face)
    what images failed testing and why
    which classifiers work best (total / non face / face / custom)
    How many [A-D] are in the top {10,200,whatever} for {tot,face,nonface}error
    Describe,explain,include? top X [A-D] classifiers for {tot,face,nonface}error
    What values of the thresholds were used? (optionally polarity for us)
